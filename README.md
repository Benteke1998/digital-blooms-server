This server.py controls a servo motor (via Raspberry Pi and PCA9685) to visualize screen use during family time. The flower moves (wilts/blooms) in real time based on screen time data received from your custom Android app.

Purpose
- Receives screen usage data via HTTP POST from the companion Android app.
- Translates phone activity into visible flower movement, using a servo motor.
- Part of the Social Blooms project for materializing digital behavior in the home.
